# CozmoDevelopmentProject
This project hosts my own applications for the Robot Cozmo


Currently the project is composed of the following modules:

1 - cozmoBehavior.py - A behavior module, which will make the robot act pro-actively
2 - cozmoGame1.py - The first version of the Boo game for the Cozmo.
